        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hey there, I'm Ibrahim Alif, a 3rd year undergrad student at <a href="https://bracu.ac.bd/" class="about-bracu">BRAC University</a>. Beside my studies,
        I'm doing a part time job as a student tutor in the same institution. My favourite hobby is to learn new things such as languages/frameworks/libraries (You can check my <a href="https://github.com/fluidpotata">github profile</a>), and my
        favourite hobby is not finishing one properly and starting with another. I'm currently working on a project for my <a href="https://discord.gg/GaZgGmsA">CSE391</a> assignment!</p>

        <h2>favourite quote</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Everything you thought had a meaning, every hope, dream, or moment of happiness, none of it matters as you lie bleeding out on the battlefield<br>
            None of it changes the fact what a speeding rock does to your body. We all die. <br>
            Does that mean our lives are meaningless? Was there no point of us being born at all. <br>
            Would you say the same for our slain comrades? What about theri lives? Were their life meaningless?<br>
            THEY WERE NOT! THERE MEMORY SERVES AS AN EXAMPLE TO ALL OF US<br>
            THE COURAGES FALLEN<br>
            THE ANGUISHED FALLEN<br>
            THEIR LIVES HAD MEANING BECAUSE WE THE LIVING REFUSE TO FORGET THEM<br>
            AND AS WE RIDE TO OUR CERTAIN DEATH WE EXPECT THE SAME FROM OUR SUCCESSORS AS WELL<br>
            BECAUSE MY SOLDIER DOESN'T BUCKLE UP OR YIELD WHEN FACED WITH THE CRUELTY OF THIS WORLD<br>
            MY SOLDIERS PUSH FORWARD<br>
            MY SOLDIERS SCREAM OUT<br>
            MY SOLDIERS RAAAAAAAAAGE</p>
